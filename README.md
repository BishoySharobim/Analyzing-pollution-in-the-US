# Analyzin pollution in the US

Analyzing fine particular matter pollution in the US from 1992 to 2008.

Fine particulate matter ($PM_{2.5}$) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is strong evidence that it is harmful to human health. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with setting national ambient air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant into the atmosphere. 

Approximately every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions of $PM_{2.5}$. This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). You can read more information about the NEI at the EPA National Emissions Inventory web site.

For each year and for each type of PM source, the NEI records how many tons of $PM_{2.5}$ were emitted from that source over the course of the entire year. The data that you will use for this assignment are for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

The purpose of this analysis is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database and see what it says about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states over the 10-year period 1999 - 2008.
